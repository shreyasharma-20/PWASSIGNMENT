        "\n",
        "The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental statistical concept that states that, given a sufficiently large sample size, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will approximate a normal distribution, regardless of the original distribution of the population. This holds true as long as the samples are independent and identically distributed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Points of the CLT:\n",
        "Sample Size: Generally, a sample size of 30 or more is considered sufficient for the CLT to apply, though this can vary depending on the shape of the population distribution.\n",
        "Independence: The samples must be drawn independently from the population.\n",
        "Normal Distribution: As the sample size increases, the distribution of the sample means will tend to be normal, even if the underlying population distribution is not.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "Suppose you want to analyze the average height of adult men in a city, where the heights are not normally distributed (e.g., they could be skewed to one side).\n",
        "\n",
        "Population: Let's say the average height is 175 cm with a standard deviation of 10 cm.\n",
        "Sampling: You take random samples of size 30 from this population.\n",
        "Sample Means: For each sample, you calculate the mean height. You do this many times (e.g., 1000 samples).\n",
        "Distribution of Sample Means: According to the CLT, if you were to plot the distribution of these sample means, it would approximate a normal distribution with:\n",
        "Mean equal to the population mean (175 cm).\n",
        "Standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size (10/√30 ≈ 1.83 cm).\n",
        "As a result, even though the original height data might be skewed, the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normal, allowing you to make inferences about the population mean using techniques that assume normality.\n",
