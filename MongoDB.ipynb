    "MongoDB transactions and SQL transactions differ in several ways, mainly due to their underlying database architectures. Here are the key differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Model\n",
    "MongoDB: Uses a document-based NoSQL model where data is stored in JSON-like BSON documents.\n",
    "SQL Databases: Use a relational model with tables, rows, and columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ACID Compliance\n",
    "MongoDB: Supports ACID transactions (since version 4.0) but is optimized for document-level operations. Multi-document transactions are available but can have performance overhead.\n",
    "SQL Databases: Designed with ACID compliance at their core, ensuring strong consistency across multiple tables and rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Scope of Transactions\n",
    "MongoDB: Transactions are mainly used for multi-document operations within a single replica set or sharded cluster.\n",
    "SQL Databases: Transactions can span multiple tables, rows, and even databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Performance Impact\n",
    "MongoDB: Since MongoDB is optimized for high-speed document-based operations, transactions introduce additional overhead, potentially reducing performance.\n",
    "SQL Databases: Transactions are natively integrated and optimized for handling multiple complex operations efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Concurrency Control\n",
    "MongoDB: Uses an optimistic concurrency control approach, where operations typically retry on failure.\n",
    "SQL Databases: Use pessimistic locking with explicit row and table locks."
